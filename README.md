This was made on stream at http://twitch.tv/riallymundane as interview practice in July 2020.

##To-Do:
Cool potential features:
- ✔ <s>add a title per list</s>
- <s>fix widths in mobile</s>
- <s>add or take away lists</s>
- <s>change background color(s)</s>
- display history of movement/add/remove
- undo delete?!
- multi delete
- <s>scroll to accommodate longer submissions</s>
- check off submissions rather than delete
- <s>actually show errors when submitting identical or empty submissions</s>
- drag and drop lists
- <s>save items in local storage so you can refresh the page</s>
- allow adding more details on click - including properly addressing overly long submissions
- <s>editing</s>
- <s>dark mode!</s>
- <s>confirm delete</s>
- larger drag handle
- keyboard shortcuts
- make a tower of hanabi game with this
- user authentication???? & backend
- write tests???!!!
- probably refactor at some point
- electron/PWA app??
- new tab chrome extension
- <s>import/export tasks</s>

> I tried to use trello and Trellno > trello

> The task system is so clunky compared to clicking and dragging, I dont want to use a drop down to finish a task, feels unsatisfying. The colors are also really nice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Drag and drop was implemented using [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
